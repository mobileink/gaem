Switching to a standard lein plugin and new template involves:

    * remove <ae>/resources, which just contains appengine-web.xml and
      web.xml; these are both converted to mustache template files,
      moved to the template plugin at
      gaem-template/src/leiningen/new/gaem, and installed to
      <proj>/etc.  The gaem config task then processes them and puts
      the result in war/WEB-INF.

    * removal of src/appengine_magic/leiningen_helpers.clj.  all that
      functionality migrates to the template and/or the new plugin.

    * removal of the lancet stuff.  replaced by std clojure.java.io

    * removal of appengine-clean.  this can be handled by setting
      :target-path in the project.clj and using lein clean, or by a
      gaem plugin "clean" subtask.

    * basically removal of all the plugin stuff from the appengine
      magic library, so it becomes just the library and the task stuff
      is in a separate plugin.  The appengine_new plugin is replaced
      by the template; the other tasks in appengine-magic/leiningen
      become subtasks of a single new gaem plugin.

Other stuff:

    * appengine-magic.core/start seems to want to install the servlet
      to service the root dir.  this should be controlled by web.xml,
      no?

    * ae/start does not read web.xml.  So running your app with a repl
      may be useful but is not sufficient - it doesn't provide a
      complete emulation of the gae environment.

    * ae also uses a set of conventions that may not work for
      everybody.  Specifically, the Getting Started example implements
      a single servlet as myapp/app_servlet.clj and puts the app logic
      in myapp/core.clj.  We drop "core" (servlet apps have no
      'center'), provide two skeletal servlets, each in a single file,
      and name them according to functionality.  We also use
      project.clj and mustache to distinguish between the Clojure name
      of the servlet and its web.xml name.

    * the general problem is that appengine-magic's dev server is an
      incomplete reimplementation of the sdk's dev server.  that's
      great insofar as it allows us to use repl development, but bad
      insofar as it is incomplete.  so a goal would be to first split
      the functionality out from the lib, and then to complete it.
